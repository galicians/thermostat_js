name = "hello"; // This is a global variable!
var name = "hello"; // That's better – an instance variable.
var name; // This creates a variable, like setting something to nil in Ruby.
In Javascript, you have to specify a return:
Game.prototype.winner = function() {
    return player1
}
'abc'.toUpperCase    // raises an error
'abc'.toUpperCase()  // that's better!
JS uses === for comparisons.
Here we're defining Player and Game classes.

function Player() {
    // code goes here
}

function Game() {
    // code goes here
}
function Player(name) {
    this.name = name;
    // Here we're passing in name as an argument and
    // initialising a player with a name.
}
############################  MATCHERS  ###################################

expect(x).toEqual(y); compares objects or primitives x and y and passes if they are equivalent

expect(x).toBe(y); compares objects or primitives x and y and passes if they are the same object

expect(x).toMatch(pattern); compares x to string or regular expression pattern and passes if they match

expect(x).toBeDefined(); passes if x is not undefined

expect(x).toBeUndefined(); passes if x is undefined

expect(x).toBeNull(); passes if x is null

expect(x).toBeTruthy(); passes if x evaluates to true

expect(x).toBeFalsy(); passes if x evaluates to false

expect(x).toContain(y); passes if array or string x contains y

expect(x).toBeLessThan(y); passes if x is less than y

expect(x).toBeGreaterThan(y); passes if x is greater than y

expect(function(){fn();}).toThrow(e); passes if function fn throws exception e when executed

Every matcher's criteria can be inverted by prepending .not:

expect(x).not.toEqual(y); compares objects or primitives x and y and passes if they are not equivalent

###############################  TESTS  ####################################

5 Steps of good protocol Javascript testing with Jasmine

STEP 1
describe({
    // create the closing brackets to create the description
});  
STEP 2
describe('', function (){
    // add the quotation marks, comma, function and parenthesis
});
STEP 3
describe('', function (){

    it({
        // create the closing brackets to create the test
    });

});  
STEP 4
describe('', function (){

    it('', function(){
        // add the quitation marks, comma, function and parenthesis for the test
    });

});
STEP 5
describe('', function (){

    it('', function(){
        expect(class.test).to(outcome); // add your expectations and outcome for the test. 
    });

}); 


##########################  JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX  ##############################


JavaScript Functions are Objects
In JavaScript, functions are objects.

JavaScript functions have properties and methods.

You can add your own properties and methods to functions.

how do i jasmine --> http://evanhahn.com/how-do-i-jasmine/

describe --> is what we call a suite

it() function --> the spec

the check is called a matcher

For each suite, you can have a bajillion specs for the bajillion tests you want to do.


############################  GIT BRANCHING: ########################

http://longair.net/blog/2009/04/16/git-fetch-and-merge/

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge


https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches

you can see your branch --> git branch

git branch development
git checkout development


To create a branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch: git checkout -b development

now:
 git branch board
 git checkout board
 and you commit
 your branch board has moved forward and has code development doesn't have

 switch back to your master branch.

 if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch you’re checking out, Git won’t let you switch branches. It’s best to have a clean working state when you switch branches.


 To merge it back into your master branch to deploy to production:

 git merge board

 you’ll delete the hotfix branch, because you no longer need it:

 git branch -d board




git history

git pull is feching and merging at the same time



Doubts im working on development i add, commit and then i merge with test,
it says already updatodate

commit your changes or stage them before you can switch branches
